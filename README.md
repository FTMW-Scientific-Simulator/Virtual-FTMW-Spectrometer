# Virtual-FTMW-Spectrometer

The Virtual FTMW Spectrometer (FTMW-SIS) is a web-based educational tool designed to simulate the operation of a Fourier Transform Microwave (FTMW) spectrometer. Developed for academic use, this simulator enables students to explore rotational spectroscopy principles, generate molecular spectra, and interact with a virtual FTMW instrument, providing hands-on learning without physical hardware. The code base is based off of The Virtual FTIR web application found here (https://ftir.rastonlab.org/).

This project uses [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) for the frontend and [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask/) for the backend. The backend is located in a separate [repository](https://github.com/RastonLab/Virtual-FTMW-Functions).

## Installation

Information on how to run the front-end can be found in the repository's [wiki page](../../wiki).

## Usage

The intended audience for this application is undergraduate chemistry students studying spectroscopy. The following screenshots are not exhaustive but acknowledge most of the main features:

- Experimental Setup (Shows the spectrometerâ€™s physical setup, including the vacuum chamber, molecular beam source, and microwave source )
