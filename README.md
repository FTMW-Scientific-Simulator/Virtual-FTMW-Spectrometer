# Virtual-FTMW-Spectrometer

The Virtual FTMW Spectrometer (FTMW-SIS) is a web-based educational tool designed to simulate the operation of a Fourier Transform Microwave (FTMW) spectrometer. Developed for academic use, this simulator enables students to explore rotational spectroscopy principles, generate molecular spectra, and interact with a virtual FTMW instrument, providing hands-on learning without physical hardware.

This project uses [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) for the frontend and [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask/) for the backend. The backend is located in a separate [repository](https://github.com/RastonLab/Virtual-FTMW-Functions).

## Installation

Information on how to run the front-end can be found in the repository's [wiki page](../../wiki).

## Usage

The intended audience for this application is undergraduate chemistry students studying spectroscopy. The following screenshots are not exhaustive but acknowledge most of the main features:

- Experimental Setup (spectrometer parameters)

## Additional Information

Additional information regarding the FTMW-SIS can be found in the repository's [wiki page](../../wiki). This information includes Redux Toolkit, SVG diagrams, SVG optimization, SVG interactivity, and SVG animation.

## Contributing

Upkeep of this project is intended for recruited undergraduate students, but pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
